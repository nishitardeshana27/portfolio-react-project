## Component Details

### App.jsx
The main component that brings together all section components in the correct order. It provides the overall page structure with a header, main content, and footer.

```jsx
function App() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-light">
      <Header />
      
      <main>
        <Hero />
        <About />
        <Skills />
        <Projects />
        <Contact />
      </main>
      
      <Footer />
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Header.jsx
A responsive navigation header with the following features:
- Fixed positioning at the top of the page
- Brand logo/text
- Navigation links to different sections
- Mobile-responsive hamburger menu toggle
- Smooth scrolling to page sections

The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage the mobile menu's open/closed state.

### Hero.jsx
The landing section that introduces the developer with:
- Name and professional title
- Brief introduction
- Call-to-action buttons
- Social media links
- Profile image with circular framing
- Subtle background gradient

### About.jsx
Provides personal information about the developer:
- Professional summary
- Educational background
- Career goals and aspirations
- Stats counters showing experience metrics (years of experience, projects completed, clients)

### Skills.jsx
Showcases the developer's technical and soft skills organized into categories:
- Frontend skills (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, etc.)
- Tools & Others (Git, GitHub, VS Code, etc.)
- Soft Skills (Problem Solving, Communication, etc.)

Each skill category is rendered in a card with a list of specific skills.

```jsx
const skills = [
  {
    category: "Frontend",
    items: ["HTML5", "CSS3", "JavaScript", "React.js", "Tailwind CSS"]
  },
  {
    category: "Tools & Others",
    items: ["Git", "GitHub", "VS Code", "Responsive Design", "Figma"]
  },
  {
    category: "Soft Skills",
    items: ["Problem Solving", "Communication", "Teamwork", "Time Management", "Adaptability"]
  }
];
```

### Projects.jsx
Displays the developer's portfolio projects with:
- Project filtering by category
- Project cards with:
  - Project image
  - Title and description
  - Technologies used (tags)
  - Links to GitHub repository and live demo
- Hover effects for interactive feedback

The component uses React's `useState` to manage the active filter category.

```jsx
const projects = [
  {
    title: "Personal Portfolio",
    description: "A responsive personal portfolio website built with React and Tailwind CSS...",
    image: "https://via.placeholder.com/600x400",
    technologies: ["React", "Tailwind CSS", "Vite"],
    github: "https://github.com/yourusername/portfolio",
    demo: "https://your-portfolio.com"
  },
  // Additional projects...
];
```

### Contact.jsx
An interactive contact form section with:
- Gradient background with decorative elements
- Two-column layout (information + form)
- Form validation for required fields and email format
- Loading state during submission
- Success message after submission
- Contact information and social links

This component demonstrates more advanced React patterns:
- Form state management
- Form validation
- Conditional rendering
- Simulated asynchronous operations

```jsx
const Contact = () => {
  const [formData, setFormData] = useState({
    name: '',
    email: '',
    subject: '',
    message: ''
  })
  
  const [formErrors, setFormErrors] = useState({})
  const [submitStatus, setSubmitStatus] = useState(null)
  
  // Form validation logic
  const validateForm = () => {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Form handlers
  const handleChange = (e) => {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  // Component rendering...
}
```

### Footer.jsx
The page footer containing:
- Brand logo/text
- Quick navigation links
- Contact information
- Social media links
- Copyright information
- Credits

## Styling System

The project uses Tailwind CSS with custom configuration for consistent styling:

### Custom Theme
The `tailwind.config.js` file defines custom colors and font family:

```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: "#3b82f6",  // Blue
      secondary: "#64748b", // Slate gray
      dark: "#0f172a",     // Nearly black
      light: "#f8fafc",    // Very light gray
    },
    fontFamily: {
      sans: ['Inter', 'sans-serif'],
    },
  },
},
```

### Custom Components
The `index.css` file defines reusable utility classes using Tailwind's `@layer components`:

```css
@layer components {
  .container {
    @apply max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8;
  }
  
  .btn {
    @apply px-5 py-2 rounded-md font-medium transition-colors duration-200;
  }
  
  .btn-primary {
    @apply btn bg-primary text-white hover:bg-primary/90;
  }
  
  .btn-outline {
    @apply btn border border-primary text-primary hover:bg-primary/10;
  }
  
  .section {
    @apply py-16;
  }
  
  .section-title {
    @apply text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold mb-8 text-center;
  }
}
```

## Responsive Design

The portfolio is fully responsive, adapting to various screen sizes:
- **Mobile-first approach**: Base styling is for small screens
- **Responsive navigation**: Changes to hamburger menu on small screens
- **Grid layouts**: Adjust columns based on screen width (`grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3`)
- **Flexible typography**: Font sizes adjust with screen size (`text-4xl md:text-5xl`)
- **Component stacking**: Elements stack vertically on mobile and horizontally on larger screens

## Animation and Interactivity

Several components use animation for enhanced user experience:
- **Contact form**: Input field focus effects and button hover states
- **Projects**: Card hover effects for images and interactive filter buttons
- **Buttons**: Hover and active states with color transitions

## Form Validation

The Contact component includes client-side validation:
- Required field validation
- Email format validation
- Minimum message length check
- Visual feedback for errors
- Success message on submission

## Getting Started
